#Running the Model for other players:
If you want to run the model for other players, you can run use the code in the file "voto swing probability" and make the following changes:
```python
playerid_lookup('votto','joey')
```
Here, you can input the name of the player you want to run the model on to get there MLBam key. This will return a dataframe with several different IDs for the 
player, make sure to use the one under the column 'key_mlbam' for the next step.

Once you have the ID you need, put it in place of Votto's ID in this line:
```python
data0 = statcast_batter('2015-03-15','2020-09-08',458015)
```
This will get the pitch-by-pitch data for the specified player that will be used to train the model. After this, you should be able to run the rest of the code
with no additional changes.
